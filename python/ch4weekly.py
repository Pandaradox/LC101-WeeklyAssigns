nums = [12, 10, 32, 3, 66, 17, 42, 99, 20]

# TODO 1
# print each number on a new line
# your code here:
for number in nums:
 print(number)

# TODO 2
# print each number and its square on a new line
# so that each line reads, for example, like this: The square of 12 is 144
# your code here:
for number in nums:
 print("The square of {} is {}".format(number,number**2))
